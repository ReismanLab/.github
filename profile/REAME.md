\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 The goal of the Reisman Group is to contribute creative solutions to fundamental problems in chemistry that impact society. Our research is driven by discoveries and innovations in organic chemistry, where new chemical reactions or synthetic design concepts can enable the synthesis of small molecules for the study and treatment of human disease. While pursuing our scientific goals, we are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive community in our laboratory. Our strength and success as a group is built on the foundation of a wide range of perspectives. The diversity of skills, thought, and experiences, allow us as a group to ask important questions and creatively solve problems. We recognize and embrace diversity in many forms: different backgrounds, races, ethnicities, nationalities, religions, sexes, sexual orientations, genders, gender identities, socioeconomic statuses, ages, physical abilities, marital and family statuses, and more. Our goal is to create and maintain a culture of inclusivity by respecting, encouraging, and engaging diverse perspectives, in order to better our science and ourselves.}
